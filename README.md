# üìò Advanced Java ‚Äì My Backend Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is a showcase of my hands-on projects while learning **Java Web Development** using key technologies like **Servlets**, **JSP**, **Spring**, **Spring Boot**, and **Hibernate**. The projects are designed to demonstrate my understanding of backend systems and real-world applications.

## üöÄ Technologies & Key Learnings

### üß© **Servlets**
- Learned the **Servlet lifecycle** (init, doGet, doPost, destroy) to handle HTTP requests and responses effectively.
- Gained practical experience with **request/response handling** using `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse`.
- Mastered **session management** using **HTTP cookies** and **session tracking**.
- Implemented **request forwarding** and **redirection** (e.g., login and error handling).
- Built applications following the **MVC pattern** with servlets acting as controllers.
- Integrated **JDBC** with servlets to manage data, validate user input, and retrieve information from a database.

### üßæ **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**
- Developed **dynamic web pages** using **JSP** and **Java Expression Language (EL)** to display content.
- Used **JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library)** for efficient iteration, conditionals, and formatting.
- Implemented **form handling** in JSP for user interaction (e.g., login, registration forms).
- Built the **view layer** in the **MVC architecture** while delegating business logic to servlets.

### üå± **Spring Framework**
- Mastered **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Inversion of Control (IoC)** in Spring, making code more modular and testable.
- Configured Spring beans using **XML** and **Java-based configuration**.
- Developed applications using **Spring MVC** with **@Controller**, **@RequestMapping**, and model-view separation.
- Implemented **Spring JDBC** for database connectivity, simplifying database access and management.
- Created modular applications by leveraging **Spring‚Äôs dependency injection** to wire components efficiently.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Spring Boot**
- Built **Spring Boot applications** with minimal configuration using `@SpringBootApplication`.
- Developed **RESTful APIs** using **@RestController** and exposed **JSON** responses.
- Leveraged **Spring Boot‚Äôs auto-configuration** to simplify setup and integration.
- Integrated **Spring Data JPA** to easily interact with relational databases and perform **CRUD operations**.
- Used **Maven** for project management, dependency handling, and building **runnable JARs** for deployment.

### üõ† **Hibernate (ORM)**
- Learned to map **Java classes** to **database tables** using **annotations** (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`).
- Configured **Hibernate‚Äôs SessionFactory** and **Session** for managing database operations.
- Performed **CRUD operations** using **Hibernate** APIs, including **HQL** (Hibernate Query Language) and **Criteria API**.
- Gained hands-on experience in **transaction management** and **lazy vs eager loading** strategies.
- Integrated Hibernate with **Spring Boot** to streamline **ORM** and database management in a Spring context.

## üí° Skills Gained
- In-depth understanding of **Java EE** concepts, including **Servlets** and **JSP** for web development.
- Strong expertise in **Spring** and **Spring Boot**, focused on **Dependency Injection**, **Spring MVC**, and **RESTful API** development.
- Hands-on experience with **Hibernate ORM**, **JPA**, and **database integration**.
- Proficient in **Maven** for building, managing dependencies, and running projects.
- Solid understanding of **best practices** like **MVC** architecture, **DAO pattern**, and **unit testing** in Java.
